## Info

**Current** is an app that claims to let you earn money by listening to music. The app is sketchy, and typically trashes the reward as you get closed to it.

If you have developer options turned on, the app will not let you use it until you turn them off. This is very sketchy, and is a violation of Google Play policy.

Once you turn developer settings off, the app will hijack your developer settings and not let you turn them back on until you delete the app. No legitimate app should be able to do this.

Current really isn't worth your time. Trust me, I tested it. It isn't very hard to remove, it doesn't block uninstallation, so all you have to do is uninstall it.

## How to remove

A reminder of how to uninstall apps on Android:

1. Hold down on the app icon with your finger

2. Click the delete option

3. Click "yes" on the `Are you sure you want to delete this app` dialog

4. You have successfully uninstalled the app.,

The app does not try to block uninstallation. It may leave some bad things behind, so try restarting your phone afterwards.

## Side comment

I knew this was a scam based on previous ads. The time I installed this malware was when I was trying to get lots of free gold on AdVenture Capitalist (back when I didn't know better) I turned off my developer settings, as I really wanted the 140+ gold. I later removed it, and never got the reward, despite reaching the criteria.

Despite Google's claims of there "being a much higher chance of a meteor hitting the Earth than getting malware from Google Play" you can still easily get malware on Google Play. There is tons of it. Unfortunately, this one managed to get into the spotlight and stay in the spotlight, likely causing many, many more copycats to be made. Try to avoid apps that claim to "let you earn gift cards/money by playing games/listening to music/doing x" they are all scams. It is a bad trend that has been going strong for over a year now. It is not a sustainable business model, and anyone doing it is scamming you.
